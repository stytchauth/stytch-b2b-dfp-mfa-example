# Stytch B2B DFP Adaptive MFA Example
This example app shows how to leverage Stytch's Device Fingerprinting (DFP) product to power adaptive MFA, only stepping users up to MFA when they log in from a new device.

In order to run this example app you need to have signed up for a Stytch account, and request access to our DFP product (a step we require for security purposes).

## Get Started
Ensure you have pip, python and virtualenv installed

#### 1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-b2b-dfp-mfa-example.git
cd stytch-b2b-dfp-mfa-example
```

#### 2. Setup a virtualenv

We suggest creating a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and activating it to avoid installing dependencies globally
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set ENV vars

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and update the values with your Stytch project ID, secret and public token from [the API Keys section of the Stytch Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).

#### 7. Run the Server
Run
```
python3 main.py
```
Go to http://localhost:3000/
